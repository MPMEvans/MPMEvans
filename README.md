## Hello!

My name is Mikel and I am currently learning Python through the CoGrammar Software Engineering bootcamp!

I have been teaching myself Python through various Youtube tutorials and searching  my specific issues on stackoverflow to create a couple of bots that run on Discord. The Birthday Bot is a fully operational bot that is currently in use on the server that myself and my friends use to keep track of our birthdays and posts a message on the day of someone's birthday.

The Actor Guess Bot is a current work in progress that I have been working on when I have the free time. The aim of the bot is to generate a list of 100 actors from IMDB and let a user guess the name of the actor using the provided image and store their score in a leaderboard. The web_scraper file in the repository is 100% working and the main file is able to run without any errors, however the actual code for the guessing game still needs to be written.

I will be more active on GitHub with more projects to better showcase the skills that I have learned on this bootcamp.
