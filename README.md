## Hello!

My name is Mikel and I am currently learning Python through the CoGrammar Software Engineering bootcamp! I have been teaching myself Python through various Youtube tutorials and searching  my specific issues on stackoverflow to create a couple of bots that run on Discord.

You can find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikel-evans-a31bb313b/ or contact me directly at my email address mikey-evans@hotmail.co.uk

# My Projects
https://github.com/MPMEvans/Birthday-Bot
The Birthday Bot is a fully operational Discord bot that is currently in use on the server that myself and my friends use to keep track of our birthdays and posts a message on the day of someone's birthday. It has functionality to allow anyone to add or remove birthdays from the bot's storage, though this may be updated later on so only an admin of the server can do it. This change is not a high priority however, as the bot is only intended for personal use.

https://github.com/MPMEvans/Actor-Guess-Bot
The Actor Guess Bot is a current work in progress that I have been working on when I have the free time. The aim of the bot is to generate a list of 100 actors from IMDB and let a user guess the name of the actor using the provided image and store their score in a leaderboard. The web_scraper file in the repository is 100% working and the main file is able to run without any errors, however the actual code for the guessing game still needs to be written.

# Future plans
I will be more active on GitHub with more projects to better showcase the skills that I am learning on this bootcamp.
